- **Red Mars** – Kim Stanley Robinson      
    <sub>Astonishing book. I loved the back and forth between Ann and Sax on terraforming Mars: “The beauty of Mars exists in the human mind...”
    </sub>

- **The Pillars of the Earth** – Ken Follett      
    <sub>My first non-fantasy read on medieval life in Europe — pairs well with the movie Becket, though I liked the latter much more.
    </sub>

- **Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers** – Leonard Koren      
    <sub>Short book that helped me appreciate some of the Wabi-Sabi subtleties in Huntington Garden.
    </sub>

- **Poor Charlie’s Almanack** – Charles T. Munger      
    <sub>I shied away from reading this at first, thinking it was a cliché. But oh man, Munger was sharp and full of unexpected insights. For a taste, check out Talk Two: A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom.
    </sub>

- **The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World** – David Deutsch      
    <sub>I first tried reading this book in freshman college unsuccessfully. This was my second attempt, but I still couldn’t bring myself to finish it despite a lot of people liking it.
    </sub>

- **A History of Ancient Rome in Twelve Coins** – Gareth Harney      
    <sub>Much more engaging than I anticipated. Romans carried portable mints into battle to pay their troops with freshly coined propaganda.
    </sub>

- **Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage** – Alfred Lansing   
    <sub>A compelling narrative of the trans-Antarctic expedition, highlighting Shackleton’s exceptional judgment of his men’s mood and his dynamic optimization of their roles within his survival strategy. 
    </sub>

- **The Catalyst: RNA and the Quest to Unlock Life's Deepest Secrets** – Thomas R. Cech   
    <sub>Before AI, determining the 3D shape of RNA was a painstaking challenge. The discovery of ribozymes overturned the belief that only proteins could catalyze reactions. Life may have begun with self-replicating RNA.
    </sub>

- **A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?** – Kelly and Zach Weinersmith   
  <sub>A bit too pessimistic for my taste, focusing too much on today’s tech limitations rather than the wilder possibilities of space settlement with post-AGI, fully gene-edited humans.</sub>

- **A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains** – Max S. Bennett

  <sub>A memoir that made me reflect on my mortality and what gives my life meaning.</sub>

- **Ayn Rand and the World She Made** – Anne Conover Heller
